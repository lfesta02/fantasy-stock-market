# My Personal Project - Fantasy Stock Market

## Proposal

My idea for this term project is to create an imaginary, simulated stock market that can be interacted with. The user
will play the role of an investor - they will be given a starting amount of cash, from which they can buy stocks and try
to make a profit. Of course, it won't be very realistic: for one, it will be *much*, *much* simpler than the actual
market. Both the size of the market and the investor's abilities will be of a smaller scale. Also, I plan to make the
fantasy market generally more volatile than real life, mostly because I think it'll be more interesting. However, there
will still be certain stocks that are much more stable than others, similar to real life.

For the most part this software will be used for entertainment ; I think there are much better choices if someone wanted
to really learn about investing and the stock market. However, I suppose it could be a decent introduction to the basic
concept of investing because of how simple it will be. I decided on this idea mainly because I like the concept of
simulating something. I have played a few games involving simulation, and I think it's cool to be able to recreate
events without having to undertake the risk or stress of actually doing them. And although I'm a complete beginner when
it comes to investing, I find the stock market quite intriguing and thought it would be a fun thing to simulate.
